We provide an overview of the GAIA API in the Description section below.
</p>
<p>
The GAIA library was designed to support various tasks common to the
alignment, identification, and analysis of relational data.
As such, the GAIA library is designed to be a modular library
and tool which supports tasks ranging from loading and generating graphs
to applying various inference models for problems like collective classification,
link prediction, entity resolution, and group detection.
At the core of GAIA is the graph interface defined in the {@link linqs.gaia.graph} package.
The graph interface was designed to be a general graph which supports
both directed and undirected hyperedges, as well as multiple node and edge types.
The types of the node, edge, and graph are defined by their schema id and
corresponding schema (defined in {@link linqs.gaia.feature.schema}) which defines
the names and types of their features (defined in {@link linqs.gaia.feature}).
GAIA supports features which return many different types, from numbers to categorical values,
as well as explicit ({@link linqs.gaia.feature.ExplicitFeature})
and derived ({@link linqs.gaia.feature.DerivedFeature}) features.
The values of explicit must be explicity specified (i.e., specified in the data or set by a model)
where derived feature are derived from the graph by a defined function to return a value on demand
(i.e., counting the number of neighbors with a given label).

<p>
GAIA supports functionality for different ways to work with graphs.
We now highlight a few packages which to guide new users to learning
and understanding the various implementations available in GAIA.

<p>
We also note that GAIA uses third party libraries for some of its functionality.
A list of those third party libraries, as well as which functionality in GAIA
relies on those, are given at the
<a href="http://linqs.cs.umd.edu/trac/gaia/wiki/ThirdPartyLibraries">Website</a>
